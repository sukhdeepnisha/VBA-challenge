This repository contains assignment for module 2 challenge.

Created a script that loops all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
1. The ticker symbol
2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percent change from the opening price at the beginning of the given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.
5. The stock with Greatest % increase, Greatest % decrease and Greatest total volume.

Enabled VBA script to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once. Also, used conditional formatting that will highlight positive yearly change in green and negative yearly change in red.
